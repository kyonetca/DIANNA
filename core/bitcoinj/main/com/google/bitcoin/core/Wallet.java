    // receiving coins. If a tx is both inbound and outbound (spend with change) it is considered outbound for the
    // purposes of the explanation below.
    //
    // 1. Outbound tx is created by us: ->pending
    // 2. Outbound tx that was broadcast is accepted into the main chain:
    //     <-pending  and
    //       If there is a change output  ->unspent
    //       If there is no change output ->spent
    // 3. Outbound tx that was broadcast is accepted into a side chain:
    //     ->inactive  (remains in pending).
    // 4. Inbound tx is accepted into the best chain:
    //     ->unspent/spent
    // 5. Inbound tx is accepted into a side chain:
    //     ->inactive
    //     Whilst it's also 'pending' in some sense, in that miners will probably try and incorporate it into the
    //     best chain, we don't mark it as such here. It'll eventually show up after a re-org.
    // 6. Outbound tx that is pending shares inputs with a tx that appears in the main chain:
    //     <-pending ->dead
    //
    // Re-orgs:
    // 1. Tx is present in old chain and not present in new chain
    //       <-unspent/spent  ->pending
    //       These newly inactive transactions will (if they are relevant to us) eventually come back via receive()
    //       as miners resurrect them and re-include into the new best chain.
    // 2. Tx is not present in old chain and is present in new chain
    //       <-inactive  and  ->unspent/spent
    // 3. Tx is present in new chain and shares inputs with a pending transaction, including those that were resurrected
    //    due to point (1)
    //       <-pending ->dead
    //
    // Balance:
    // 1. Sum up all unspent outputs of the transactions in unspent.
    // 2. Subtract the inputs of transactions in pending.
    // 3. If requested, re-add the outputs of pending transactions that are mine. This is the estimated balance.
