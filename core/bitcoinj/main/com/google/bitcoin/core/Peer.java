        // where that chain is up to or even if the top block we have is even still in the chain - we
        // might have got ourselves onto a fork that was later resolved by the network.
        //
        // To solve this, we send the peer a block locator which is just a list of block hashes. It contains the
        // blocks we know about, but not all of them, just enough of them so the peer can figure out if we did end up
        // on a fork and if so, what the earliest still valid block we know about is likely to be.
        //
        // Once it has decided which blocks we need, it will send us an inv with up to 500 block messages. We may
        // have some of them already if we already have a block chain and just need to catch up. Once we request the
        // last block, if there are still more to come it sends us an "inv" containing only the hash of the head
        // block.
        //
        // That causes us to download the head block but then we find (in processBlock) that we can't connect
        // it to the chain yet because we don't have the intermediate blocks. So we rerun this function building a
        // new block locator describing where we're up to.
        //
        // The getblocks with the new locator gets us another inv with another bunch of blocks. We download them once
        // again. This time when the peer sends us an inv with the head block, we already have it so we won't download
        // it again - but we recognize this case as special and call back into blockChainDownload to continue the
        // process.
        //
        // So this is a complicated process but it has the advantage that we can download a chain of enormous length
        // in a relatively stateless manner and with constant memory usage.
        //
        // All this is made more complicated by the desire to skip downloading the bodies of blocks that pre-date the
        // 'fast catchup time', which is usually set to the creation date of the earliest key in the wallet. Because

        // use the "getheaders" command. Once we find we've gone past the target date, we throw away the downloaded
